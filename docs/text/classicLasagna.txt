Step-by-Step Instructions (1100+ Words)
Step 1: Prepare the Meat Sauce
Start by heating 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook for 3–4 minutes until softened and translucent. Stir occasionally so the onion doesn’t brown too quickly. Once it softens, add the minced garlic and cook for another 30 seconds until fragrant.
Add the 1 lb of ground beef to the skillet. Break it apart with a spoon as it cooks. Continue stirring until the meat is browned with no pink remaining. If there’s a noticeable amount of grease, drain excess fat—but leave a little for flavor.
Now add your tomato ingredients: the 28 oz crushed tomatoes, 14 oz tomato sauce, and 2 tablespoons tomato paste. The tomato paste deepens the flavor and thickens the sauce.
Season the sauce with 1 teaspoon dried basil, 1 teaspoon oregano, 1 teaspoon salt, and ½ teaspoon pepper. Add ½ teaspoon sugar if your tomatoes taste acidic. Stir everything well so the sauce becomes uniform.
Reduce the heat to low and let the sauce simmer for 15–20 minutes. This simmering time allows the flavors to blend and the tomato flavor to mellow. Stir occasionally as it cooks to prevent sticking.
You’ll know it's ready when the color deepens slightly and the sauce thickens. Turn off the heat and let it rest while you prepare the cheese layer.

Step 2: Prepare the Cheese Mixture
In a medium bowl, combine:
•	15 oz ricotta
•	1 egg
•	½ cup grated Parmesan
•	1 teaspoon dried parsley
•	Pinch of salt and pepper
Mix everything until smooth and creamy. The egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn’t ooze out during baking. The parsley adds a mild, fresh lift that balances the richness of the cheeses.
Set the bowl aside. This layer is what gives lasagna its creamy base.

Step 3: Cook the Noodles (If Not Using Oven-Ready)
If you’re using oven-ready noodles, skip this step.
If you’re using regular noodles:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add 9–12 lasagna noodles and cook until slightly underdone, about 6–7 minutes (they will finish cooking in the oven).
Gently stir during the first minute to prevent sticking. When done, drain and lay the noodles flat on parchment paper or lightly oiled foil to keep them from sticking together.
Avoid stacking them—they glue themselves together quickly.

Step 4: Preheat the Oven
Set your oven to 375°F (190°C) so it’s ready when you build your lasagna.

Step 5: Assemble the Lasagna
This is where the magic happens. A well-made lasagna has balanced layers: meat, cheese, noodles, and sauce.
Here’s the order you’ll follow:
Layer 1: Sauce
Spread about 1 cup of your meat sauce on the bottom of a 9×13 baking dish. This prevents sticking and helps soften the bottom noodles.
Layer 2: Noodles
Place 3–4 lasagna noodles on top of the sauce. They can overlap slightly.
Layer 3: Ricotta Mixture
Spread ⅓ of the ricotta mixture over the noodles. Use a spoon or spatula to gently spread it evenly.
Layer 4: Mozzarella
Sprinkle 1 cup of shredded mozzarella evenly over the ricotta.
Layer 5: Meat Sauce
Add another generous layer of your meat sauce—about 1 to 1½ cups.
Repeat this sequence two more times:
Noodles → Ricotta → Mozzarella → Meat Sauce
For the top layer, finish with:
•	A final layer of noodles
•	The remaining meat sauce
•	A generous topping of mozzarella
•	A sprinkle of Parmesan
The top should be well covered in cheese so it browns beautifully in the oven.

Step 6: Bake the Lasagna
Cover the baking dish with foil, but tent it slightly so the foil doesn’t touch the cheese. Covering it helps the lasagna steam and cook evenly.
Bake at 375°F (190°C) for 25 minutes covered.
After 25 minutes, remove the foil and bake another 15–20 minutes, or until the cheese on top is melted, bubbly, and slightly browned.
For an extra browned top, broil the lasagna for 2–3 minutes, watching carefully to prevent burning.
Your kitchen should now smell unbelievably good.

Step 7: Let It Rest (Very Important)
This is the step most people skip—but it’s crucial.
Let the lasagna rest for 10–15 minutes before cutting.
Why?
Because fresh from the oven, it’s extremely hot and the layers are loose. Resting helps everything set, allowing clean slices. Cutting too early will make the layers slide apart.
Cover lightly with foil while it rests to keep it warm.

Tips for Perfect Lasagna
•	Use freshly grated mozzarella—pre-shredded has anti-caking agents that affect melting.
•	Don’t skip resting time—lifetime-changing difference.
•	Give the sauce time to simmer for deeper flavor.
•	Don’t overload with ricotta—balance is key.
•	Always end with sauce + cheese on top.
