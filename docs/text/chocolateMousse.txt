Chocolate mousse is one of those desserts that feels luxurious but doesn’t require complicated skills or elaborate equipment. It’s smooth, airy, rich, and silky—everything a perfect chocolate dessert should be. Even though mousse sounds fancy, the steps are extremely approachable when broken down carefully. This recipe explains each stage in detail so you fully understand the “why” behind each technique. By the end, you’ll be able to make a restaurant-quality chocolate mousse confidently and consistently.

Egg Mixture:
•	3 large eggs, separated
•	⅓ cup granulated sugar

Step 1: Prepare Your Ingredients and Tools
Before beginning, set up everything you need. Chocolate mousse moves quickly in a few steps, and having ingredients ready ensures nothing curdles, melts too fast, or deflates.
You’ll need:
•	A heat-safe bowl
•	A saucepan
•	Clean mixing bowls
•	An electric mixer or whisk
•	A rubber spatula
Make sure the bowl you’ll use for whipping cream is cold. Cold bowls help cream whip faster and produce more volume.
Chop your chocolate into small pieces. Smaller pieces melt faster and more evenly, preventing overheating.

Step 2: Melt the Chocolate
Place the chopped chocolate and 2 tablespoons butter in a heat-safe bowl. Set the bowl over a pot with a little simmering water—this creates a gentle double boiler. The bowl should not touch the water. Steam alone will melt the chocolate evenly.
Stir occasionally while it melts. The butter makes the chocolate smoother and easier to fold later.
Once fully melted and glossy, remove the bowl from the heat and let it cool slightly. You don’t want it hot when you add other ingredients, or it may seize or scramble the eggs.

Step 3: Separate the Eggs
Separate the 3 eggs into two bowls—yolks in one, whites in another. It’s essential to keep egg whites free of even a single drop of yolk, or they won’t whip properly.
Let the egg yolks come to room temperature. They’ll blend more easily into the chocolate later.
Egg whites should remain cold until whipping, unless using a hand mixer immediately.

Step 4: Whip the Egg Whites
Using a clean, dry bowl and beaters, whip the egg whites on medium speed until they turn foamy. Gradually add ⅓ cup sugar, one tablespoon at a time. Continue whipping until the whites form soft peaks, then eventually medium-firm peaks.
This means when you lift the whisk out, the peaks should hold their shape but still curl softly at the tip. Avoid whipping to stiff peaks, which can make folding difficult and cause the mousse to lose smoothness.
These whipped whites help give the mousse its airy, delicate texture.

Step 5: Mix the Egg Yolks
Beat the egg yolks gently with a fork to break them up. Add 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. The vanilla enhances the chocolate flavor and softens the intensity without overpowering it.
If the melted chocolate has cooled to warm (not hot), stir the egg yolks into the chocolate. If the chocolate is still too warm, wait—adding yolks to hot chocolate can cook them, which would ruin the texture.
Mix until the yolks are fully blended and the mixture becomes shiny and thick.

Step 6: Combine Chocolate and Egg Whites Slowly
This step determines the smoothness and airiness of your mousse.
Start by adding one-third of the whipped egg whites to the chocolate mixture. Use a rubber spatula to fold them in gently. This first addition lightens the chocolate so the rest of the whites can blend without deflating.
Folding means scooping from the bottom, lifting upward, and turning the mixture over itself. Do not stir vigorously—stirring will knock out the air.
Once incorporated, fold in the remaining egg whites in two more additions. Move slowly but confidently. Your goal is a smooth, fluffy mixture with no visible streaks of white.

Step 7: Whip the Heavy Cream
In a cold bowl, add 1 cup heavy cream and 2 tablespoons powdered sugar. Whip on medium-high speed until soft-to-medium peaks form. If the cream becomes too stiff, it won’t blend smoothly into the mousse.
Whipped cream adds richness and silkiness, balancing the lightness from the egg whites.

Step 8: Fold in the Whipped Cream
Add the whipped cream to the chocolate mixture, folding gently just like before. The mixture will become lighter in color and texture. Fold until everything is uniform and fluffy.
Proper folding ensures the mousse holds air and sets with the perfect texture.

Step 9: Chill the Mousse
Spoon the mousse into:
•	Glasses
•	Ramekins
•	Dessert cups
•	Or a large serving bowl
Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, but preferably 4. Chilling allows the mousse to set fully, firming up while retaining its airy structure.
After chilling, the mousse should be light, smooth, and spoonable—not runny or overly dense.

Additional Tips for Perfect Chocolate Mousse
Use quality chocolate
The flavor of mousse depends heavily on chocolate, so choose a high-quality bar rather than chocolate chips.
Don’t rush melting
High heat ruins chocolate. Gentle heat leads to perfect texture.
Fold, don’t stir
Stirring knocks out air, resulting in dense mousse.
Chill properly
Under-chilled mousse tastes more like chocolate pudding than mousse.
Use clean tools
Any oil or egg yolk residue prevents egg whites from whipping.

Orange Chocolate Mousse

Dark Chocolate Mousse

Swap semi-sweet chocolate for white chocolate and reduce sugar.
