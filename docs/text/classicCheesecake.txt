Classic Homemade Cheesecake
For the Crust
•	1 ½ cups (150 g) graham cracker crumbs
•	2 tablespoons granulated sugar
•	6 tablespoons melted butter
For the Cheesecake Filling
•	24 oz (680 g) cream cheese, softened to room temperature
•	1 cup granulated sugar
•	1 cup sour cream, room temperature
•	3 large eggs, room temperature
•	1 teaspoon vanilla extract
•	2 tablespoons all-purpose flour (optional, for extra stability)
Optional Toppings
•	Fresh berries
•	Caramel sauce
•	Chocolate ganache
•	Berry compote
•	Whipped cream

Step 1: Prepare the Pan and Preheat the Oven
Set your oven to 325°F (163°C). This lower temperature prevents cracking and ensures the cheesecake bakes evenly.
Use a 9-inch springform pan, which allows you to release the cheesecake cleanly without damaging the sides. Wrap the outside of the pan tightly in two layers of aluminum foil. This protects it when you place it in a water bath later, preventing leaks.
Lightly grease the inside of the pan with butter or nonstick spray.

Step 2: Make the Graham Cracker Crust
In a medium bowl, combine:
•	1 ½ cups graham crumbs
•	2 tablespoons sugar
•	6 tablespoons melted butter
Stir until the mixture resembles wet sand and clumps when pressed together. If it feels too dry and crumbly, add another tablespoon of melted butter.
Pour the crumb mixture into the springform pan and press it firmly into the bottom using the back of a spoon or the bottom of a measuring cup. Pack it tightly—this ensures a crust that doesn’t fall apart.
Bake the crust alone for 8–10 minutes, then set it aside to cool.

Step 3: Prepare the Cheesecake Filling
The key to a smooth cheesecake is using room temperature ingredients. Cold cream cheese creates lumps that never fully smooth out.
Place the softened cream cheese (24 oz) in a large mixing bowl. Beat on medium speed for 2–3 minutes, scraping the sides often, until completely smooth and creamy.
Add 1 cup sugar and continue mixing until incorporated.
Next, add 1 cup sour cream and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Mix just until combined. The sour cream adds moisture and tang, while the vanilla softens the overall flavor.
If you want a firmer cheesecake, add 2 tablespoons flour at this stage. Flour helps stabilize the filling and makes slicing easier, though it slightly reduces silkiness.

Step 4: Add the Eggs (Most Important Step)
Crack 3 large eggs into a separate bowl and lightly beat them.
Add the eggs to the cheesecake batter one at a time, mixing on the lowest speed. Eggs introduce air, and too much air causes cracking. Mix just until each egg disappears into the batter—no more.
Overmixing at this stage is one of the biggest reasons cheesecakes crack or rise too much.
When finished, scrape down the bowl and fold the batter gently with a spatula to ensure it’s fully uniform.

Step 5: Prepare the Water Bath (Bain-Marie)
A water bath helps the cheesecake bake slowly and evenly, preventing cracks and giving the filling its classic velvety texture.
Place the foil-wrapped springform pan into a larger roasting pan.
Heat several cups of water until hot (but not boiling). Once the cheesecake pan is in place, pour the hot water into the roasting pan until it reaches halfway up the sides of the springform pan.
The water bath:
•	Creates steam
•	Keeps the baking environment moist
•	Prevents rapid temperature changes
All of this helps produce a perfectly smooth cheesecake.

Step 6: Bake the Cheesecake
Bake at 325°F (163°C) for 60–75 minutes.
You'll know it's done when:
•	The edges look set
•	The center jiggles like soft Jell-O
•	It does not appear liquid
Do not bake until the center is firm. Cheesecake continues cooking as it cools, and overbaking leads to cracks and dryness.
Avoid opening the oven door—heat loss can cause sinking or cracking.

Step 7: Cool the Cheesecake Gradually
Once baking time is complete, turn off the oven, crack the door slightly, and leave the cheesecake inside for 1 hour.
This slow cooling prevents the top from cracking due to sudden temperature changes.
After an hour, remove the cheesecake from the oven and carefully lift it out of the water bath. Remove foil and let it cool at room temperature for another 1–2 hours.

Step 8: Chill Completely
Cover the cheesecake lightly with plastic wrap (do not press it onto the surface) and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, but ideally overnight.
Cheesecake must chill to fully set. Overnight chilling gives the best flavor and texture.

Step 9: Slice and Serve
When ready to cut, use a sharp knife dipped in hot water and wiped dry between each slice. This gives perfectly clean edges.
Add toppings like:
•	Strawberries or blueberries
•	Warm berry sauce
•	Chocolate drizzle
•	Whipped cream
Or enjoy it plain—the texture alone is dessert enough.

Tips for Perfect Cheesecake
1. Use room temperature ingredients
Smooth filling depends on it.
2. Don’t overmix after adding eggs
This causes cracks.
3. Always use a water bath
Prevents sinking and promotes creaminess.
4. Let it cool slowly
Temperature shock cracks the top.
5. Chill overnight
Cheesecake only gets better with time.
6. Use full-fat ingredients
Low-fat dairy alters texture.
