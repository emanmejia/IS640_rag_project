Step-by-Step Instructions (Detailed)
Step 1: Prepare your chicken
Start by placing your chicken breasts or thighs on a cutting board. Using a clean, sharp knife, cut the chicken into medium-sized cubes, about 1 inch in size. Keeping the pieces uniform helps them cook evenly. Once cut, take a few paper towels and gently pat the chicken dry. This step is important; removing moisture helps the chicken brown nicely rather than steam in the pan.
Place the dried chicken pieces into a medium mixing bowl. Set the bowl aside for seasoning.

Step 2: Season thoroughly
To the bowl of chicken, add 1 teaspoon of salt, ½ teaspoon of black pepper, 1 teaspoon of paprika, and ½ teaspoon of garlic powder. You can sprinkle each ingredient evenly over the surface of the chicken so that the seasoning coats more evenly when mixed.
Using clean hands or a spoon, toss the chicken pieces until every cube is well coated with seasoning. You shouldn’t see any big dry patches or unseasoned surfaces. Good seasoning at the start means the final dish has deeper flavor without requiring a heavy sauce or marinade.
When the chicken is evenly coated, let it sit while you prepare your pan. This short resting time—just a few minutes—allows the spices to adhere fully.

Step 3: Heat the pan properly
Place a large skillet or frying pan on the stove and turn the heat to medium-high. Proper heat is key to getting a golden brown sear. Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil into the pan, followed by 1 tablespoon of butter. Using both gives you flavor plus a higher smoke point so the butter doesn’t burn immediately.
Let the oil and butter heat until the butter melts completely and begins to bubble lightly. You want the pan hot but not smoking aggressively. If the butter starts turning dark brown right away, lower the heat slightly before adding your chicken.

Step 4: Sear the chicken
Carefully add the seasoned chicken into the hot pan. Spread the pieces out so they form a single layer. Avoid piling them on top of each other—crowding prevents browning. If necessary, cook in two batches rather than forcing everything in at once.
Once the chicken is in the pan, let it sit without stirring for at least 2–3 minutes. This stillness is what allows the chicken to develop a golden crust. You might hear sizzling—that’s a good sign. After the first few minutes, use tongs or a spatula to flip or stir the chicken pieces.
Continue cooking the chicken for another 4–5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the outside is golden and the inside is fully cooked. The pieces should no longer look pink when cut open. The total cooking time is usually about 7–8 minutes depending on the size of the cubes.

Step 5: Add garlic and more butter
Reduce the heat to medium. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter to the pan. Once it begins to melt, sprinkle the minced garlic over the chicken. Stir everything gently so the garlic mixes into the butter and coats the chicken.
This step does not take long—about one minute. Garlic cooks quickly, and burning it can make it taste bitter. Stir continuously and let the garlic get fragrant and lightly golden. The smell will shift from sharp to warm and aromatic, which tells you it’s ready.

Step 6: Add lemon and parsley
Turn off the heat. While the pan is still warm, add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and 1 tablespoon of chopped parsley. Stir to combine.
The lemon juice brightens the dish without making it sour, and the parsley adds color and a mild freshness. Both ingredients balance the richness of the butter-garlic mixture. If you don’t like lemon, you can skip this step—or replace the lemon juice with a teaspoon of soy sauce for a slightly deeper flavor.

Step 7: Taste and adjust
Cooking is personal, so take a moment to taste one piece of chicken. If it needs more salt, add a small pinch (⅛ teaspoon at a time). If you want more heat, sprinkle a bit of paprika or even a pinch of red pepper flakes. If you prefer a richer sauce, swirl in another teaspoon of butter while the pan is still warm.
These micro-adjustments help you find your perfect flavor.

Step 8: Serve properly
This meal pairs beautifully with almost anything. Serve it over:
•	Steamed rice
•	Garlic mashed potatoes
•	Buttered pasta
•	Roasted vegetables
•	A quick side salad
Before serving, spoon some of the extra garlic butter sauce from the pan over the chicken. This step ensures every bite stays moist, flavorful, and rich.
