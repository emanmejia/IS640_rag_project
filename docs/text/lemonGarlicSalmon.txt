Step-by-Step Instructions (1100+ Words)
Step 1: Choose the Right Salmon
Before you begin, it helps to understand what kind of salmon works best. Skin-on salmon is preferred because the skin protects the delicate flesh from direct heat, helping it cook more evenly. The skin crisps nicely in the pan, and it also acts as a natural barrier against sticking.
Look for fillets with bright color—orange or deep pink, depending on the type. Avoid fillets with a milky residue or strong fishy smell. Fresh salmon has a clean scent and firm texture. If using frozen salmon, thaw it completely in the refrigerator overnight or under cold water before cooking.

Step 2: Prepare the Salmon Properly
Pat the salmon dry using paper towels. This step is essential. Moisture is the enemy of browning, and if the fillets are wet, they will steam instead of sear.
Season both sides with ½ teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon black pepper. Seasoning the skin helps it crisp, and seasoning the flesh enhances flavor from the inside.
Let the fish sit for 5 minutes while you prepare the pan. Allowing it to rest slightly helps it cook more evenly once it hits the heat.

Step 3: Preheat the Pan
Place a medium skillet on the stove over medium-high heat. A stainless-steel or cast-iron pan gives the best sear, but nonstick pans also work well and reduce sticking risks.
Add 1 tablespoon olive oil and swirl it around the pan. You want the oil shimmering but not smoking. A properly heated pan is crucial—if the pan is too cold, the salmon sticks; if too hot, the garlic and butter will burn later.

Step 4: Sear the Salmon Skin-Side Down
Carefully place the salmon fillets in the pan, skin-side down. The skin should make contact with the hot pan immediately and begin to crisp.
Press gently with a spatula for the first 10–15 seconds. This keeps the skin flat so it doesn’t curl up. Let the salmon cook undisturbed for 4 minutes. This allows the skin to crisp and gives the salmon a golden base.
During this time, the edges of the salmon will begin to turn opaque. This gradual, bottom-up cooking is what gives salmon its tender flakiness.

Step 5: Flip and Cook the Other Side
After 4 minutes, gently slide a spatula under the salmon and flip it. The skin should release easily if the pan was hot enough.
Cook on the second side for 2–3 minutes. At this stage, reduce the heat slightly if the pan looks too hot. Salmon cooks quickly, and it’s better to undercook slightly and finish with carryover heat than to overcook.
When pressed lightly with your finger or fork, the salmon should feel firm but still springy—never mushy or overly firm.

Step 6: Add Butter and Garlic
Once the salmon has cooked on the second side for about a minute, lower the heat to medium-low. Add 1 tablespoon unsalted butter to the skillet. As it melts, it will begin mixing with the olive oil, creating a rich base for the sauce.
Add the 3 minced garlic cloves to the butter. Garlic burns easily, so keeping the heat lower here is important. Stir the garlic around the salmon so it cooks evenly without sticking to one spot.
Cook the garlic for 30–45 seconds, just until fragrant. You will smell the shift from raw, sharp garlic to warm, mellow garlic. That’s the signal to move to the next step.

Step 7: Add Lemon and Baste
Turn off the heat or lower it to the lowest setting. Add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice directly into the butter and garlic mixture. You can also add a little lemon zest (½ teaspoon) if you want stronger citrus flavor.
Tilt the pan slightly and use a spoon to scoop the lemon-garlic-butter over the top of the salmon repeatedly. This technique, called basting, adds moisture, flavor, and shine. It helps finish cooking the top of the fillet gently without drying it out.
Baste for 30–60 seconds, enough to coat the salmon several times.

Step 8: Rest the Salmon
Remove the salmon from the pan and let it rest for 2 minutes on a plate. Resting allows the juices inside the salmon to redistribute. Cutting too early can cause those juices to spill out, leading to dryness.
During this time, spoon any remaining garlic lemon butter from the pan over the top.

Step 9: Serve and Garnish
Serve the salmon with simple garnishes like:
•	Lemon slices
•	Fresh parsley
•	A pinch of red pepper flakes
•	A drizzle of leftover pan sauce
Each addition enhances flavor without overpowering the delicate taste of the salmon.
This dish pairs beautifully with rice, mashed potatoes, roasted vegetables, sautéed greens, or a crisp salad.

 Extra Tips for Perfect Salmon
1. Don’t overcook
Salmon tastes best when slightly moist inside. Internal temperature should reach 125–130°F for medium doneness.
2. Use fresh garlic
Jarred garlic burns more easily and has sharper, less pleasant flavor.
3. Don’t move the salmon
Letting the skin sear undisturbed ensures crispness and prevents sticking.
4. Use real lemon
Bottled lemon juice tastes flat and metallic.
5. Balance salt
Salmon needs seasoning, but lemon and garlic both enhance saltiness, so avoid oversalting.

 Storage and Reheating
Refrigeration:
Store cooled salmon in an airtight container for up to 3 days.
Reheating:
•	Heat gently in a skillet over low heat.
•	Or microwave for 20–30 seconds at a time.
Avoid overheating, which dries the salmon.
Freezing:
Salmon can be frozen but may lose some texture. Freeze up to 2 months.
